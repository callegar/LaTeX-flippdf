The "flippdf" package extends LaTeX making it possible to typeset a "mirrored"
version of the document. This is sometimes required by publishers who use
printing processes that require "camera-ready" documents to be printable on
transparent films, so that one reads the pages correctly by looking through the
film (i.e., with the unprinted side of the film towards his eyes). This package
requires "everypage" by the same author and works with pdfLaTeX only.
